# Ventoy: The Ultimate USB Multi-Boot Tool

Ever get tired of re-flashing your USB every time you wanna try out a new OS or recovery tool? Yeah, same here. That's why I mess with **Ventoy** ‚Äî it completely changes the bootable USB game.

With one setup, you can throw in as many `.iso` files as you want and boot any of 'em straight up. No need to format, no more creating new drives per ISO.

<Callout type="info">
  Ventoy is especially useful for devs, IT folks, and power users who deal with
  a bunch of OSes or tools. One USB. Multiple ISOs. Let that sink in.

## Why Ventoy?

- Works with **legacy BIOS & UEFI**

- Supports Windows, Linux distros, utility ISOs, and more
- 100% free & open source
- Lightweight, portable, zero bloat

If you're the type who likes testing OS builds, helping friends fix their laptops, or even just likes having options when things go wrong ‚Äî Ventoy is a must-have.

## What You‚Äôll Need

- A USB drive (8GB minimum, 16GB+ preferred)
- Some `.iso` files (Windows, Linux, utilities, etc.)
- [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/download.html) (obviously)

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Download Ventoy

Head to the [official download page](https://www.ventoy.net/en/download.html) and grab the latest release. Extract the zip once it‚Äôs downloaded.

### 2. Install Ventoy to Your USB Drive

- Open `Ventoy2Disk.exe`
- Pick your USB drive
- Hit **Install** (‚ö†Ô∏è this will wipe the USB ‚Äî back up your stuff)
- After it's done, your USB is now Ventoy-powered

<Callout type="warning">
  <span className="text-black">
    You only need to install Ventoy once. After that, you're just
    adding/deleting ISO files like it‚Äôs a normal flash drive.

### 3. Add ISO Files

Just open the USB in Explorer and drop in your `.iso` files. Done.

Want a Windows installer? Drop it in. Wanna boot into Kali Linux? Toss it in too. Even mix and match ‚Äî no problem.
